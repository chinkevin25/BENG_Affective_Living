This is a Senior Design Project for UCSD that was done in collaboration with Qusp (now Intheon). The goal of his project was to create a closed loop system using Neuroscale (EEG analysis platform), Muse (EEG), LiFX(Smart Light) and an Android phone in an attempt to reduce an individual's level of stress through exposure of a specific color of light. 

This project was in collaboration with Kunaal Goel (UCSD), Tim Fong (UCSD), Neel Parekh (UCSD) and Lin Zhang (Qusp).

Lin Zhang provided the skeleton of the Android Application and was tweaked by us to work in the context of our project.

This application does not actually build as of this commit, as there was most likely source control errors. At the time of the project (2015-2016) we did not use GitHub often and I pulled this version from a shared drive.
